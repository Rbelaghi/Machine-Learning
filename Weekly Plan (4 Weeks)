Suggested dates align to Weeks 47–50 of 2025 (Nov 17 – Dec 12), maintaining the Monday/Friday rhythm.

### Week 1 — Foundations, R Basics & Logistic Regression

- **Synchronous 1 (Lecture/Discussion):** Intro to R, data workflow and cleaning, missing data; overview of supervised vs unsupervised ML; logistic regression (model, interpretation, diagnostics).  
- **Synchronous 2 (Lab):** Hands-on data cleaning, fitting logistic regression, prediction, and evaluation metrics (confusion matrix, ROC/AUC) in R.

### Week 2 — Trees & Ensembles (Merged Module)

- **Synchronous 1 (Lecture/Discussion):** Decision Trees (splits, pruning) → Random Forests (bagging, OOB, importance).  
- **Synchronous 2 (Lab):** Implement trees & RF in R; tuning with resampling.

### Week 3 — Margins & Kernels; Simple Neural Nets

- **Synchronous 1 (Lecture/Discussion):** Support Vector Machines (margins, kernels, C/γ) and ANN basics (layers, activations, overfitting).  
- **Synchronous 2 (Lab):** SVM classification in R (kernels, tuning); simple MLP (e.g., via `keras` or `nnet`).  
- **Deliverable:** *Assignment due end of Week 3.*

### Week 4 — Integration & Presentations

- **Synchronous 1 (Workshop):** Reception of the previous sessions and reproducible pipelines (`renv`, `targets`/`drake`), reporting, and error analysis.  
- **Synchronous 2 (Presentations):** Final Project Presentations (20 min talk + 5 min Q&A per student/team).  
- **Deliverable:** Slides + short report (2–4 pages) with methods, results, interpretation, and reproducible code repo.

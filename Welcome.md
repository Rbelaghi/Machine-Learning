## Welcome Message

Welcome to **Hands-on Machine Learning in Life Science with R**!  
We are excited to have you join this intensive and applied course on statistical and machine learning methods tailored for biological, agricultural, and health data.

This course follows a **flipped classroom** format: you are expected to **review the lecture materials and short recordings before each live session**. Each lecture will be **recorded and made available** for later review.  
Please come **prepared for discussion**, bring your **questions**, and engage actively during the synchronous sessions — our goal is to make the sessions collaborative, interactive, and practice-driven.

We look forward to learning with you!  
— *Reza Belaghi & Ali Moazzami*
